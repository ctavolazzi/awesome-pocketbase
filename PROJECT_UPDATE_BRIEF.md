# PocketBase Cyber Plaza â€“ Update Brief

Welcome! This document explains what the PocketBase Cyber Plaza project is today and how weâ€™re planning to evolve it over the next few weeks. Share it with anyone who wants to understand the roadmap without diving into implementation details.

---

## 1. Project Snapshot
- **What we have:** A web demo that showcases a retro-inspired social feed powered by PocketBase, Express, and vanilla JavaScript.
- **What works well:** Real-time updates, optimistic post composer, activity logging, and a playful 90s aesthetic.
- **What needs attention:** Most front-end logic lives in a single file, event handling is hard to follow, and we lack the diagrams/wireframes needed for onboarding and long-term maintenance.

## 2. Why Weâ€™re Updating It
We want a modular, well-documented codebase that supports experimentation and future features. The primary goals are to:
1. Break the monolithic front-end into small, testable components.
2. Introduce a clear state management and event flow strategy.
3. Refresh documentation with diagrams, wireframes, and explainers that anyone on the team can reference.

These goals are captured in detail in `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md` and tracked as a work effort in `work_efforts/00-09_project_management/01_work_efforts/00.07_application_overhaul.md`.

## 3. What Work Is Coming Up
We will progress through six phases (Discovery â†’ Foundations â†’ Componentization â†’ Event Loop Refactor â†’ Integrations â†’ Hardening). Each phase delivers specific outcomes:
- **Discovery:** Audit the current app, collect baseline metrics, and align on scope.
- **Foundations:** Stand up an application shell, state store prototype, and service facades.
- **Componentization:** Migrate major UI blocks (auth, feed, composer, comments, layout).
- **Event Loop Refactor:** Replace ad-hoc listeners with predictable dispatch/subscribe flows.
- **Integrations:** Reconnect realtime updates, analytics, logging, and the nostalgic extras.
- **Hardening:** Bake in performance tuning, accessibility checks, and a final documentation pass.

Target dates and exit criteria for each phase are listed in the work effort file.

## 4. Whoâ€™s Involved
- **Architecture Working Group (sponsors):** Sets direction, approves design decisions.
- **Frontend engineers:** Execute the refactor, add tests, maintain documentation.
- **UX/Design partner:** Produces wireframes and validates component breakdowns.
- **QA engineer:** Owns regression strategy and phase sign-offs.
- **Project manager:** Tracks progress, schedules reviews, and keeps dependencies unblocked.

## 5. Deliverables to Expect
- Updated component modules under `pocketbase-demo/public/components/`.
- A centralized state store and action catalog describing the event loop.
- A suite of diagrams and wireframes stored in `docs/visuals/` (with README guidance).
- Migration playbook detailing rollout, rollback, and testing strategy.

## 6. How to Follow Along
- **Application plan:** `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md` (architecture, diagrams, timelines).
- **Work effort tracker:** `work_efforts/00-09_project_management/01_work_efforts/00.07_application_overhaul.md`.
- **Visual assets:** `docs/visuals/` (diagrams, wireframes, exports).
- **Component inventory:** `COMPONENTS.md` for the current UI pieces.

Weekly updates will be posted in the #pocketbase-frontend channel, and each phase ends with a demo plus documentation walkthrough.

## 7. Getting Involved
- Join the weekly architecture sync (30 minutes).
- Pick up tasks from the Phase 0 backlog (to be published in the issue tracker).
- Contribute wireframes or diagram drafts and drop them into `docs/visuals/`.
- Review documentation as it landsâ€”fresh eyes help ensure itâ€™s approachable.
