**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Work Effort:** [[../01_work_efforts/00.01_ollama_90s_social_feed|Ollama 90s Social Feed]]

## Objective
Transform the 3-column 90s Cyber Plaza layout into a modern, single-column social media application (Twitter/Reddit/Threads-style) while preserving the nostalgic 90s aesthetic.

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation ✅
**Duration:** ~30 minutes

#### Database Schema Updates (`setup.mjs`)
- Added voting fields to posts: `upvotes`, `downvotes`, `upvotedBy`, `downvotedBy`
- Added voting fields to comments: `upvotes`, `downvotes`
- Added `parentComment` self-referencing field for nested replies
- Created migration script (`migrate-posts.mjs`) for existing data

#### Data Service Extensions (`data.service.js`)
- `votePost(postId, voteType)` - Toggle upvote/downvote with user tracking
- `getComments(postId)` - Fetch comments with expanded author data
- `createComment(postId, content, parentId?)` - Create top-level or reply comments
- `voteComment(commentId, voteType)` - Simple vote counting for comments
- `deleteComment(commentId)` - Delete comment with permissions

### Phase 2: Frontend Restructure ✅
**Duration:** ~1 hour

#### HTML Complete Rewrite (`index.html`)
- **Cyber Navbar**: Fixed top navigation with hamburger menu and profile button
- **Sliding Menu**: 320px sidebar with user profile, auth forms, stats, activity log
- **Single-Column Feed**: Centered layout (max-width 650px) with infinite scroll
- **Removed**: Old 3-column grid layout, sidebars, old topbar

#### CSS Major Updates (`style.css`)
Added ~500 lines of new styles:
- Navbar with gradient background and 90s outset borders
- Sliding menu with transform animations
- Semi-transparent overlay backdrop
- Redesigned post cards with avatar header
- Vote button styles with active states
- Comment thread styles with indentation
- Mobile responsive breakpoints (768px, 480px)

#### JavaScript Complete Rewrite (`app.js`)
Rewrote entire file (~900 lines):
- **Avatar System**: Hash-based emoji selection (12 variations)
- **Menu System**: Smooth slide-in/out with overlay
- **Voting System**: Toggle logic, optimistic UI updates, active states
- **Comment System**: Recursive rendering, inline replies, nested threads
- **Post Rendering**: New card structure with avatar, votes, comments
- **Infinite Scroll**: Auto-load on scroll, loading indicators

### Phase 3: Features Implementation ✅
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours

#### Voting System
- Upvote/downvote buttons with emoji icons (⬆️⬇️)
- User tracking (can't vote multiple times)
- Toggle behavior (click again to remove vote)
- Mutual exclusivity (upvote removes downvote)
- Net vote display (+5, -2, etc.)
- Active state glow effects (green/red)
- Auth-gated (must be signed in)

#### Comment System
- Expandable comment threads (click "💬 Comments")
- Nested replies up to 3 levels deep
- Visual indentation (20px, 40px, 60px)
- Inline reply forms with cancel button
- Comment voting (upvote/downvote)
- Delete own comments
- Recursive rendering algorithm
- Lazy loading (only when expanded)

#### Avatar System
- 12 emoji options: 💾, 🤖, 👾, 🌟, 💿, 📀, 🎮, 🕹️, 💻, 📱, 🖥️, ⌨️
- Consistent per user (hash-based deterministic selection)
- Multiple sizes:
  - 48px on post cards
  - 64px in menu profile
  - 32px on comments
  - 24px in navbar
- Displayed with gradient background and beveled borders

#### Menu System
- Smooth cubic-bezier animation
- Body scroll lock when open
- Click overlay to close
- ESC key support would be nice (future)
- Auto-close on login/register/logout

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing ✅
**Duration:** ~30 minutes

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint at 768px for tablets
- Breakpoint at 480px for phones
- Menu width adjusts (280px on mobile)
- Post actions stack vertically on small screens
- Avatar sizes scale appropriately

#### 90s Aesthetic Preservation
- ✅ Comic Sans MS & Courier New fonts
- ✅ Beveled borders (ridge/outset/inset)
- ✅ Neon colors (cyan, magenta, yellow)
- ✅ Blinking animations
- ✅ Starfield background
- ✅ Construction banner
- ✅ Hit counter
- ✅ Browser badges
- ✅ Retro button styles

## Technical Highlights

### State Management
- `feedState` Map for posts
- `commentState` Map for comments
- Efficient lookups by ID
- Optimistic UI updates

### Performance Optimizations
- Comments lazy-load on expand
- Infinite scroll with 20 posts per page
- Realtime updates via WebSocket
- Canvas-based starfield animation

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on buttons
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

### Code Quality
- No linter errors
- Modular architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-commented code

## Challenges Solved

### 1. Self-Referencing Schema Field
**Problem**: PocketBase wouldn't accept `parentComment` field with empty `collectionId`
**Solution**: Create collection first, then add self-referencing field in a second update

### 2. Infinite Scroll with New Posts
**Problem**: How to handle new posts arriving while user is scrolled down
**Solution**: Always insert at top for now (simpler UX, can enhance later)

### 3. Comment Depth Limiting
**Problem**: Preventing infinite nesting
**Solution**: Max 3 levels enforced in UI, no reply button on level 3

### 4. Vote Toggle Logic
**Problem**: Complex state management for voting
**Solution**: Track user IDs in arrays, calculate net votes, update UI optimistically
