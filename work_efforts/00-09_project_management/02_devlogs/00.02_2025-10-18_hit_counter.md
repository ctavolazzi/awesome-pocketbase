# DevLog · 2025-10-18 — Hit Counter & Visitor Tracking

## Summary
- Added a retro-styled hit counter widget to the PocketFeed UI so every page load increments a shared visitor count.
- Wired the counter to the existing `site_stats` collection, updating `visitor_count` and `last_visit` on each refresh.
- Introduced a flip animation for digits and ensured the widget stays out of the way on smaller screens.
- Logged milestone in the work effort tracker and documented behaviour for future collaborators.

## Implementation Notes
- Injected hit counter markup near the end of `public/index.html` so it overlays the page without affecting layout content.
- Extended `public/style.css` with 90s-inspired gradients, neon colours, and a `digitFlip` keyframe animation; the widget hides below 720px wide viewports.
- Added `updateHitCounter()` and `displayCounter()` helpers to `public/app.js`; the counter fetches the first `site_stats` record, increments it, and animates digit changes.
- `init()` now awaits `updateHitCounter()` after establishing auth state to guarantee the visit is recorded before other async work.
- Updated the work effort record (`00.01_ollama_90s_social_feed.md`) so the hit-counter task shows as complete.

## Testing
- [x] Counter renders on page load and defaults to `000000` before the update.
- [x] Refreshing the page increments the visitor count and animates changed digits.
- [x] Updated value persists across multiple reloads (verified by inspecting the `site_stats` record in PocketBase admin UI).
- [x] Console remains free of errors when the counter updates successfully.
- [x] Counter widget hides automatically on narrow viewports (<720px).

No automated tests were added; behaviour verified manually in the local environment.
