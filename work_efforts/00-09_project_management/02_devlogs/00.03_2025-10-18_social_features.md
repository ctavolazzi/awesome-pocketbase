# DevLog · 2025-10-18 — Social Feed Infrastructure & AI Personas

## Summary
- Implemented pageable feed infrastructure with infinite scroll, loading states, and an end-of-feed banner so timelines can scale past 50 posts.
- Added scroll-aware realtime handling: new posts insert instantly when you are at the top, otherwise a sticky “↑ X new posts” indicator tracks unseen activity.
- Expanded the AI system to rotate among four themed personas (TechGuru42, DeepThoughts, LOL_Master, NewsBot90s); each uses tailored prompts for Ollama.
- Seeded the new persona accounts in `setup.mjs` and upgraded `ollama-feed.mjs` to include persona context, rotation logic, and jittered posting cadence.

## Implementation Notes
### Pagination & Infinite Scroll
- Replaced the fixed `getList(1, 50)` call with a paging helper (`POSTS_PER_PAGE = 20`) that appends results while preserving order.
- Added scroll listeners on `.feed-card` to load the next page when within 200px of the bottom; guarded by `isLoading`/`hasMorePosts` flags.
- Introduced `loadingIndicator` and `endOfFeed` UI states plus a helper to sync Map-backed feed state with DOM inserts.

### Smart Realtime Updates
- Tracked whether the viewport is near the top—new posts animate in when visible, otherwise they increment a counter and surface a sticky banner.
- Added `scrollFeedToTop()` helper and button that smooth-scrolls back and refreshes page 1 to hydrate pending posts.
- Wireframed animations (`slideIn`, `slideOut`) for both creation and deletion, matching the retro look without reflow glitches.

### Multi-Persona AI Bot
- Seed scripts now provision four additional persona accounts alongside the demo/editor/Ollama users.
- `ollama-feed.mjs` rotates personas without back-to-back repeats, caches user IDs, and crafts persona-specific prompts with style descriptors.
- Each loop cycle logs the posting persona and respects the existing jitter (`INTERVAL_MS + random(0–15s)`).

### UI Enhancements
- Feed card became the scroll container; the posts list now hosts only the entries, while loading indicators/EOF banners reside beneath it.
- Added a sticky new-posts banner and retro-styled spinner/end-of-feed blocks consistent with the Cyber Plaza theme.

## Files Touched
- `pocketbase-demo/public/app.js`, `index.html`, `style.css`
- `pocketbase-demo/setup.mjs`, `ollama-feed.mjs`
- Documentation: `README.md`, `FEATURES.md`, work effort log, session dossier, new devlog

## Testing
- [x] Manual scroll test with >60 posts (seed + AI output) to confirm infinite scroll appends correctly.
- [x] Verified loading spinner/end-of-feed banner visibility at appropriate times.
- [x] Observed realtime behaviour when scrolled down (banner increments) and when at top (immediate insert + animation).
- [x] Confirmed persona rotation by running `npm run ollama -- --once` repeatedly and checking console logs/authors.
- [x] Checked new posts indicator button to ensure smooth scroll + feed reload.
- [ ] Automated tests (deferred; manual validation only).

## Follow-ups
- Consider a manual "Load older posts" button for accessibility (currently relying on infinite scroll only).
- Evaluate virtualized rendering if timelines exceed several thousand entries.
- Optional: store persona metadata in `users` collection for runtime prompt customization.
