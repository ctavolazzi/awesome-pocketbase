# DevLog: MIME Type Fix for ES Modules

**Date:** 2025-10-18 (Saturday)
**Time:** 18:43 - 18:48 PDT
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Problem
Application failed to load with the following error:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script
but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

This prevented the entire application from initializing, as the main `app.js` module couldn't be loaded by the browser.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **live-server** was serving files with incorrect MIME types
2. The `--entry-file=public/index.html` flag was causing routing confusion
3. Two stale processes were running on port 4173 (PIDs: 96679, 96211)
4. ES modules require strict MIME type checking (`application/javascript` or `text/javascript`)

## Solution
Switched from `live-server` to Python's built-in HTTP server, which correctly handles MIME types for JavaScript modules.

### Steps Taken
1. **Killed stale processes:**
   ```bash
   kill 96679 96211
   ```

2. **Started Python HTTP server from public directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ctavolazzi/Code/awesome-pocketbase/pocketbase-demo/public
   python3 -m http.server 4173
   ```

3. **Verified MIME types:**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:4173/app.js
   curl -I http://localhost:4173/services/data.service.js
   curl -I http://localhost:4173/utils/validator.js
   ```

### Results
✅ All JavaScript files now served with `Content-type: application/javascript`
✅ HTML files served with `Content-type: text/html`
✅ Module imports working correctly
✅ Application initializes successfully

## Updated Documentation
Updated server startup instructions in work effort document:
- [[00.04_mime_type_fix]] - Complete solution details

## Technical Details
- **Server:** Python 3.10.0 SimpleHTTP/0.6
- **Port:** 4173
- **Root Directory:** `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/awesome-pocketbase/pocketbase-demo/public`
- **MIME Type:** `application/javascript` (correct)
- **Previous Server:** live-server with `--entry-file` flag (incorrect)

## Lessons Learned
1. Python's SimpleHTTP server is more reliable for serving ES modules than live-server
2. The `--entry-file` flag in live-server can interfere with module resolution
3. Always verify MIME types with `curl -I` when troubleshooting module loading
4. Alternative solution: `npx serve public -p 4173` also works correctly

## Next Steps
- ✅ Application is running correctly
- ✅ All services operational (PocketBase on 8090, Web on 4173)
- Ready for continued development

## Server Status
- **PocketBase:** ✅ Running on port 8090
- **Web Server:** ✅ Running on port 4173 (Python SimpleHTTP)
- **Application:** ✅ Loading correctly with all modules
