# Archives Index

## Overview
This subcategory contains archived documentation and deprecated content that has been superseded by newer, consolidated versions.

## Purpose

The archives preserve historical documentation that:
- Has been consolidated into unified documents
- Contains outdated session-specific information
- Provides historical context for development decisions
- May be useful for understanding project evolution

## Why Documents Were Archived

### Consolidation Rationale

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Multiple session recaps contained overlapping information
2. **Improved Navigation**: Single consolidated document is easier to reference
3. **Better Organization**: Categorized content is more accessible
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: One source of truth reduces update overhead
5. **Clearer Context**: Merged documents provide complete picture

### Benefits of Consolidation

- **For New Contributors**: Easier onboarding with clear, unified documentation
- **For Developers**: Faster reference lookup without searching multiple files
- **For Maintainers**: Reduced documentation maintenance burden
- **For Project**: Better documentation quality and consistency
