# Work Effort: Frontend Architecture Overhaul

## Status: In Progress
**Kickoff:** 2025-10-20
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - OpenAI Integration
**Sponsor:** Architecture Working Group
**Primary Doc:** `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md`

## Objective
Refactor the PocketBase Cyber Plaza frontend into a modular, well-documented system by decomposing monolithic scripts, establishing a predictable event architecture, and delivering supporting diagrams, wireframes, and technical documentation.

## Scope
- Implement the layered architecture outlined in `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md`.
- Migrate UI concerns into discrete component modules (Composer, Feed, Auth, Comments, Layout, Experience).
- Introduce centralized state management and a documented event loop.
- Refresh realtime integrations, logging, and telemetry for the new architecture.
- Produce architecture diagrams, event maps, and low-fidelity wireframes hosted under `docs/visuals/`.

## Out of Scope
- Backend schema changes beyond what the refactor requires.
- Non-web client updates (mobile, CLI).
- Visual redesign beyond minor adjustments needed to support modularization.

## Deliverables
1. Updated application shell with service initialization & store wiring.
2. Component directories with interface docs and unit test scaffolds.
3. Event/action catalog & developer handbook describing dispatch/subscription flows.
4. Visual artifact set: component diagram, sequence diagrams, wireframes (PNG/SVG + mermaid sources).
5. Migration playbook for releasing the refactored UI (rollback, testing, deployment checklists).

## Milestones & Dates
| Milestone | Target Date | Exit Criteria |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Phase 0 – Discovery Complete | 2025-10-22 | Baseline audit, updated backlog, confirmed resourcing |
| Phase 1 – Architecture Foundations | 2025-10-29 | Store prototype, service facades, shell bootstrapped |
| Phase 2 – Componentization | 2025-11-08 | Core UI modules extracted, integration tests passing |
| Phase 3 – Event Loop Refactor | 2025-11-15 | Central dispatch, action catalog, logging instrumentation |
| Phase 4 – Integrations Refresh | 2025-11-22 | Realtime wrappers, analytics hooks stabilized |
| Phase 5 – Hardening & Launch | 2025-11-29 | Performance & a11y passes, documentation freeze |

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Tech Lead:** Owns architectural decisions, code reviews, risk management.
- **Frontend Engineers:** Implement modules, write tests, update docs.
- **UX/Design Partner:** Produce wireframes, validate component structure.
- **QA Engineer:** Maintain regression plan, execute phase exits.
- **Project Manager:** Track milestones, coordinate cross-team dependencies.

## Dependencies
- Availability of PocketBase/Express environments for testing.
- Finalization of state-management approach (decision by Phase 1 exit).
- UX bandwidth to deliver wireframes before componentization sprint.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Timeline slip** due to scope growth → enforce acceptance criteria per phase.
- **Regression bugs** from incremental rewrites → pair testing, add unit coverage, maintain feature toggles.
- **Documentation rot** → integrate doc updates into Definition of Done; schedule doc reviews.
- **Realtime inconsistency** → create sandbox tests replicating subscription events before go-live.

## Communication Plan
- Weekly architecture sync (30 min).
- Async updates in #pocketbase-frontend Slack channel each Friday.
- Phase reviews with sponsor including demo + doc walkthrough.

## Metrics
- Reduction of `public/app.js` LOC by ≥60%.
- Unit tests covering ≥70% of component logic.
- Mean time to understand composer flow (survey) reduced by 50%.
- Zero critical regressions post-launch (30-day window).

## Next Actions
1. Confirm staffing and kickoff date during 2025-10-19 planning call.
2. Create `docs/visuals/` directory structure and seed with diagram placeholders.
3. Draft Phase 0 backlog tasks in issue tracker referencing this work effort.
4. Capture GPT-5-nano configuration (update `.env`, `env.template`, Docker secrets) and verify connectivity with `npm run verify:openai`.
5. Log initial AI provider baseline in `logs/openai.log` and record assumptions in `BASELINE_METRICS.md`.
