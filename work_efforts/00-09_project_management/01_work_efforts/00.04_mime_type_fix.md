# Work Effort: MIME Type Fix for ES Modules

## Status: Completed
**Started:** 2025-10-18 18:43
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18 18:48
**Duration:** 5 minutes

## Objective
Fix MIME type error preventing `app.js` from loading as a JavaScript module.

## Problem Statement
Browser console shows:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script
but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

This prevents the application from initializing.

## Root Cause
- ES modules require `Content-Type: application/javascript` or `text/javascript`
- Server is returning `text/html` instead
- Likely caused by:
  1. Incorrect server configuration
  2. Path resolution issues
  3. Stale server cache
  4. `--entry-file` flag interfering with module resolution

## Tasks
- [x] Stop existing server processes
- [x] Restart server with correct configuration
- [x] Verify MIME types are served correctly
- [x] Test application loading
- [x] Update documentation if needed

## Solution Approach
1. Kill stale `live-server` processes
2. Restart server from correct directory
3. Ensure proper MIME type headers
4. Clear browser cache if needed
5. Consider alternative server if issue persists

## Technical Details
- **Server:** live-server on port 4173
- **Root Directory:** `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/awesome-pocketbase/pocketbase-demo`
- **Entry Point:** `public/index.html`
- **Module:** `public/app.js` (ES6 module)

## Expected Outcome
- Application loads without MIME type errors
- All ES modules resolve correctly
- Real-time features work as expected

## Solution Implemented
The issue was caused by `live-server` configuration. The fix was to use Python's built-in HTTP server, which properly serves JavaScript files with the correct MIME type.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Kill stale processes
kill 96679 96211

# Start Python HTTP server from public directory
cd /Users/ctavolazzi/Code/awesome-pocketbase/pocketbase-demo/public
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

**Verification:**
All files now served with correct MIME types:
- `app.js` → `application/javascript` ✓
- `services/data.service.js` → `application/javascript` ✓
- `utils/validator.js` → `application/javascript` ✓
- `schemas/*.schema.js` → `application/javascript` ✓
- `index.html` → `text/html` ✓

## Updated Server Instructions
To run the application:
```bash
# Terminal 1: PocketBase (already running on port 8090)
cd /Users/ctavolazzi/Code/awesome-pocketbase/pocketbase-demo
./pocketbase serve

# Terminal 2: Web Server
cd /Users/ctavolazzi/Code/awesome-pocketbase/pocketbase-demo/public
python3 -m http.server 4173

# Terminal 3: Ollama Feed (optional)
cd /Users/ctavolazzi/Code/awesome-pocketbase/pocketbase-demo
npm run ollama
```

## Notes
- Two processes were running on port 4173 (PIDs: 96679, 96211)
- Application recently refactored with new service/schema layers
- Python's SimpleHTTP server is more reliable for MIME types than live-server
- Alternative: `npx serve public -p 4173` also works correctly
