# Critical Bug Fixes - Action System Integration

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Context:** Phase 3 Day 1 - Fixing critical bugs before store integration
**Status:** 🔧 In Progress

---

## 🐛 Bugs Identified

Three critical bugs identified before production integration:

### Bug #1: Validation Before Middleware ✅ FIXED
**File:** `action-system.js:78`

**Problem:**
Validation ran before middleware execution, so async actions (thunks/promises) threw "Action must be an object" before the async middleware could unwrap them.

**Impact:**
- Async actions couldn't work
- Thunks (functions) rejected immediately
- Promises rejected before processing

**Fix:**
Moved validation from `dispatch()` to `_baseDispatch()` so it runs AFTER middleware transforms the action.

```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
dispatch(action) {
  if (this.enableValidation) {
    this._validateAction(action); // ❌ Too early!
  }
  // ... middleware runs ...
}

// AFTER (fixed):
dispatch(action) {
  // Middleware runs first
  return composedDispatch(action);
}

_baseDispatch(action) {
  if (this.enableValidation) {
    this._validateAction(action); // ✅ After middleware!
  }
  // ... rest of dispatch ...
}
```

### Bug #2: Store setState API Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**File:** `action-system.js:125`

**Problem:**
`_baseDispatch` called `store.setState(newState)` but the Store class only supports `setState(path, value)` with dot-notation paths. This would crash as soon as a real store was registered.

**Impact:**
- Reducer-based state updates would fail
- Runtime crash on first action dispatch
- Store integration impossible

**Fix:**
Added `replaceState()` method to Store class and updated action system to use it. Falls back to `batchUpdate()` if `replaceState()` not available.

```javascript
// Store class (new method):
replaceState(newState) {
  const oldState = { ...this.state };
  this.state = newState;
  this._recordHistory('REPLACE', null, newState, oldState);
  this._notifyAll();
  return this;
}

// Action system (updated):
if (typeof store.replaceState === 'function') {
  store.replaceState(newState);
} else {
  // Fallback for stores without replaceState
  const updates = {};
  Object.keys(newState).forEach(key => {
    updates[key] = newState[key];
  });
  store.batchUpdate(updates);
}
```

### Bug #3: Reset Wipes State Instead of Restoring ✅ FIXED
**File:** `store.js:101`

**Problem:**
`reset()` wiped store to `{}` instead of restoring initial state. Time-travel debugging relies on `reset()` to restore the initial state, then replay actions. Reducers only apply defaults when state is `undefined`, so rewinding replayed from an empty object instead of the proper initial shape.

**Impact:**
- Time-travel debugging broken
- State import/export broken
- Rewind functionality produced wrong state

**Fix:**
1. Preserve `initialState` in constructor (deep cloned)
2. Restore `initialState` in `reset()`
3. Added `_deepClone()` method for proper deep copying

```javascript
// Store constructor (updated):
constructor(name, initialState = {}) {
  this.name = name;
  this.initialState = this._deepClone(initialState); // ✅ Preserve!
  this.state = initialState;
  // ...
}

// Reset method (fixed):
reset() {
  const oldState = { ...this.state };
  this.state = this._deepClone(this.initialState); // ✅ Restore initial!
  this._recordHistory('RESET', null, this.state, oldState);
  this._notifyAll();
  return this;
}

// New helper:
_deepClone(obj) {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') return obj;
  if (obj instanceof Date) return new Date(obj);
  if (obj instanceof Array) return obj.map(item => this._deepClone(item));
  // ... handles Sets, Maps, plain objects ...
}
```

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Fixes Applied
- ✅ Bug #1: Validation moved after middleware
- ✅ Bug #2: Added `replaceState()` to Store
- ✅ Bug #3: Store `reset()` restores initial state

### 🔧 Work in Progress
- Mock stores in tests need updating for new API
- Need to ensure all stores have `replaceState()` or fallback works
- Integration testing with real stores needed

### Test Status
```
Before fixes: 28/28 passing
After fixes:  23/28 passing (5 failing due to mock store API mismatch)
```

**Note:** The 5 failing tests are due to mock stores in tests not implementing the full Store interface. This is expected during refactoring and will be fixed by updating test mocks.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Integration)
1. Update test mocks to match new Store API
2. Verify all 28 tests passing again
3. Add integration tests with real Store instances

### Phase 3 Continuation
1. Integrate action dispatch with all 5 stores
2. Create reducers for each store
3. Migrate components to use actions
4. Add realtime adapter

## 📝 Files Modified

### Production Code
- `public/store/action-system.js` - Moved validation, added replaceState fallback
- `public/store/store.js` - Added replaceState(), fixed reset(), added _deepClone()

### Tests (Need Updates)
- `tests/unit/store/action-system.test.mjs` - Mock stores need new API
