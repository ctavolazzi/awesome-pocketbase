## Application Overhaul Plan

**Status:** PLANNED (Kickoff: TBD)
**Reference:** See `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md` for full details

### Project Snapshot

**What we have:** A web demo with retro-inspired social feed powered by PocketBase, Express, and vanilla JavaScript.

**What works well:** Real-time updates, optimistic post composer, activity logging, and a playful 90s aesthetic.

**What needs attention:** Most front-end logic lives in a single file, event handling is hard to follow, and we lack diagrams/wireframes for onboarding.

### Goals

1. **Modular Architecture** - Break monolithic frontend into testable components
2. **Clear State Management** - Centralized state store and event flow
3. **Better Documentation** - Diagrams, wireframes, and explainers

### Six Phases

#### Phase 0: Discovery & Audit (1 week)
- Audit current app structure
- Collect baseline metrics
- Align on scope and priorities

#### Phase 1: Foundations (2 weeks)
- Application shell setup
- State store prototype
- Service facades

#### Phase 2: Componentization (3 weeks)
- Migrate auth UI
- Migrate feed UI
- Migrate composer
- Migrate comments
- Migrate layout components

#### Phase 3: Event Loop Refactor (2 weeks)
- Replace ad-hoc listeners
- Implement dispatch/subscribe pattern
- Clean event flow

#### Phase 4: Integrations (2 weeks)
- Reconnect realtime updates
- Add analytics hooks
- Enhance logging
- Preserve 90s extras

#### Phase 5: Hardening & Launch (2 weeks)
- Performance tuning
- Accessibility checks
- Final documentation
- Launch preparation

**Total Timeline:** ~12 weeks

### Deliverables

- Updated component modules under `pocketbase-demo/public/components/`
- Centralized state store and action catalog
- Suite of diagrams and wireframes in `docs/visuals/`
- Migration playbook for rollout

### Stakeholders

- **Architecture Working Group** - Sets direction, approves designs
- **Frontend Engineers** - Execute refactor, add tests, maintain docs
- **UX/Design Partner** - Produces wireframes, validates components
- **QA Engineer** - Owns regression strategy, phase sign-offs
- **Project Manager** - Tracks progress, schedules reviews

### How to Follow Along

- **Application Plan:** `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md`
- **Work Effort Tracker:** `work_efforts/.../00.07_application_overhaul.md`
- **Visual Assets:** `docs/visuals/`
- **Component Inventory:** `COMPONENTS.md`
