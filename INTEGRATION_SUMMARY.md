# PocketBase Demo - Integration Summary

This document summarizes the validation and integration work completed for the awesome-pocketbase demo.

## 📋 Completed Tasks

### Phase 0: SDK Compatibility & Bug Fixes (October 18, 2025)

✅ **PocketBase 0.30.4 Compatibility**
- Identified and fixed SDK version mismatch (0.21.5 → 0.26.2)
- Updated setup.mjs to handle `schema` → `fields` API change
- Moved field options (`collectionId`, `values`, `maxSelect`) from nested `options` to field level
- Fixed relation field structure for PocketBase 0.30.4+
- Fixed select field structure (values at field level)
- Updated test suite to use `fields` instead of `schema`
- Changed sort parameter from `-created` to `-id` (PocketBase 0.30.4 removed automatic timestamps)

✅ **Test Suite Fixes**
- Fixed schema validation to work with PocketBase 0.30.4's `fields` property
- Added author field to CRUD test posts (was causing validation errors)
- Fixed Read/Update test assertions
- Improved pagination and filtering tests with better error handling
- Achieved **100% test pass rate (41/41 tests passing)**

✅ **Access Rules Configuration**
- Changed rules from `null` (bypassed validation) to proper access rules
- Posts: Public read (`''`), authenticated write (`@request.auth.id != ""`)
- Comments: Public read, authenticated write
- Categories: Public read, authenticated write

✅ **Documentation Updates**
