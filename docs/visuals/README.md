# Visual Assets Guide

- Store exported diagrams, sequence maps, and wireframes that support the PocketBase Cyber Plaza overhaul.
- Keep source files (Mermaid `.md`, Excalidraw `.excalidraw`, Figma export notes) alongside rendered assets (`.svg`, `.png`).
- Mirror the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_<artifact>_<topic>.(png|svg|md)`.
- Link assets from `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md` and relevant work efforts when published.
- Commit updates together with the documentation they support to maintain traceability.

_See `APPLICATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md` ยง7 for required artifact types._
