# Awesome PocketBase Demo Hub — Comprehensive Dossier

This dossier consolidates the repository overview, MVP expectations, and the detailed development log into a single reference so contributors can grasp the project context at a glance.

## 1. Repository Overview

### Purpose of the Repository
This project curates community and official resources for the PocketBase backend while providing an offline-friendly demo hub that **shows** the current state of the Awesome list, connectivity to pocketbase.io, and contributor guidance without relying on the npm toolchain that is blocked in this environment.

### Key Assets
- `README.md` — the main Awesome list organized by technology categories.
- `contributing.md` — contribution rules mirroring the upstream Awesome project, including entry formatting guidance.
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that runs `awesome-lint`.
- `cspell.json` — spelling dictionary configuration consumed by linting tooling.
- `docs/viewer.html` — an interactive walkthrough that renders the README, surfaces live metrics, probes pocketbase.io, previews repository docs, and caches derived data to remain usable offline.

### Demo Hub Capabilities
- Caches README markup and document snippets to `localStorage` for instant offline reloads.
- Highlights live metrics (category/entry/domain counts plus last-updated timestamp).
- Builds an in-page navigation list for every level‑2 category in the README.
- Auto-runs the connectivity probe when no history exists, respects reduced-motion preferences, and supports arrow/home/end keyboard navigation across the walkthrough steps.
- Surfaces live document preview status messages (including cached fallback detail) while guarding against race conditions when switching files quickly.
- Sanitizes generated link and image attributes—anchors receive `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and image badges render correctly even when embedded inline.
- Exposes refresh and clear controls that rerun the probe and wipe cached state on demand.

### Tooling Expectations
- Run `awesome-lint` before opening a PR.
- Use `cspell` for spell checking resource descriptions.

### Environment Constraints
`awesome-lint`, `markdownlint-cli2`, and `lychee` all require npm downloads. In this sandbox the npm proxy is hard-coded to `http://proxy:8080`, which rejects outbound requests to the public registry with `403 Forbidden` responses. Clearing proxy-related environment variables leaves commands hanging because direct connections to `registry.npmjs.org` are also blocked. Without proxy credentials or an offline cache, the documentation linters cannot be executed locally.

## 2. MVP Specification

### Purpose
Deliver an immediately usable demo hub that **shows** the value of the Awesome PocketBase list through interactive, offline-friendly experiences.

### Target Audience
- New PocketBase adopters evaluating ecosystem resources.
- Contributors needing a quick visual inspection of curated links before submitting PRs.
- Maintainers presenting the list during talks or workshops without guaranteed network access.

### Core Outcomes
1. Communicate the breadth and quality of curated resources.
2. Validate external availability (pocketbase.io) at a glance.
3. Provide maintainers with actionable insight into repository health.

### Minimum Viable Product Scope
1. **Showcase the Awesome List**
   - Render the README content with category navigation.
   - Highlight aggregate stats (total entries, unique domains, last updated timestamp).
   - Support instant refresh so the view reflects local file edits.
2. **Connectivity Probe**
   - Execute a fetch to the official pocketbase.io site and report reachability, latency, and status code.
   - Persist a short local history of probe results for the current browser session.
3. **Repository Insight Panels**
   - Surface snippets from `contributing.md` and other key docs to reinforce contributor guidelines.
   - Display spelling/linting guidance even when npm-based linters are offline.

### Technical Requirements
- Single HTML file (`docs/viewer.html`) using vanilla JavaScript so the demo remains self-contained and serverless.
- Employ Fetch + `AbortController` to measure connectivity without third-party dependencies.
- Derive README metrics client-side by parsing Markdown headings and list items—no build step required.
- Store probe history and derived metrics in `localStorage` to preserve context between refreshes.
- Expose a manual refresh button that reprocesses README content and reruns probes on demand.
- Keep styling fully inlined (CSS variables + utility classes) to avoid asset pipelines.
- Provide a "Clear saved data" control that flushes cache and repopulates the walkthrough from disk/network.
- Ensure the interface is keyboard accessible and honours reduced-motion preferences while exposing ARIA busy/status cues.

### Implementation Snapshot
- README metrics cover category, entry, domain counts, and a formatted `Last-Modified` timestamp from the fetch response—persisted to `localStorage` for offline reuse.
- README markup and document snippets are cached locally so the viewer can fall back to the last successful render if fresh fetches fail.
- The inline Markdown renderer decodes and re-escapes link/image attributes so README badges display correctly and anchors stay safe.
- Heading anchors are generated for every level‑2 README category to populate an in-page navigation list.
- Connectivity probes use `AbortController` with a 6-second timeout, auto-run when no history exists, log the HTTP result/latency, and store a rolling history (capped at eight entries) in `localStorage`.
- Document previews cache fetches, timestamp responses, ignore stale results when switching files rapidly, and narrate status updates through an ARIA live region.
- Global refresh reloads README content, rebuilds navigation/metrics, restores the default document preview, and re-runs the connectivity probe immediately.

### Non-Goals
- Browser routing frameworks or SPA infrastructure.
- Automated link validation (requires the blocked npm tooling).
- PocketBase server emulation—the focus is on showcasing resources, not running PocketBase itself.

### Expert Next Steps
1. Replace the custom Markdown renderer with a vetted, offline-capable library to avoid edge-case rendering bugs.
2. Convert probe history storage from `localStorage` to an append-only JSON artifact for auditable demos.
3. Complete an accessibility pass (focus trapping, high-contrast themes) beyond the current keyboard shortcuts.
4. Ship pre-generated README metadata so the viewer loads instantly without reparsing on every refresh.
5. Document how the viewer integrates with CI once npm access or cached packages become available.

### Repository Snapshot
- **README categories scanned:** 17 level-2 sections
- **Curated entries tracked:** 68 resource links
- **Unique domains referenced:** 6 hostnames
- **Demo files touched:** `docs/viewer.html`, `README.md`, this dossier
- **Local cache keys in use:** `awesomePocketBase.readme`, `.stats`, `.nav`, `.probeHistory`, `.docs`

### Key Enhancements
1. **Demo Hub Experience**
   - Crafted a single-file viewer that renders the README, surfaces aggregate metrics, and builds a navigable table of contents directly in the browser.
   - Added keyboard-accessible stepper controls, ARIA status updates, and reduced-motion support for inclusive presentations.
2. **Connectivity Probe**
   - Implemented an abortable fetch workflow that pings `https://pocketbase.io`, records timing/status, and preserves a rolling history in `localStorage`.
   - Prevented overlapping requests, auto-ran the probe on first load, and surfaced descriptive success/error messaging.
3. **Repository Document Preview**
   - Streams snippets from `README.md`, `contributing.md`, and this dossier with caching, timestamping, and race-condition guards to keep previews accurate.
   - Introduced explicit status styling plus inline announcements for fetch state transitions.
4. **State Management & Reset**
   - Persists derived README stats, markup, navigation, probe history, and doc snippets in `localStorage` for instant reloads.
   - Added "Refresh all data" and "Clear saved data" controls that rebuild metrics, rerun probes, and flush caches on demand.
5. **Security & Sanitization**
   - Hardened the inline Markdown renderer by decoding entities before re-escaping link/image attributes and enforcing `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on anchors.
   - Normalized badge rendering so the Awesome list seal and similar images display correctly offline.

### Architecture Notes
- **Rendering Pipeline:** Fetch README → parse headings & links → render sanitized HTML → compute stats (categories, entries, domains) → cache payload for instant reloads.
- **Probe Engine:** Uses `AbortController` with a 6000 ms timeout, prevents concurrent runs, stores capped history (8 entries), and annotates latency classes (`fast`, `moderate`, `slow`).
- **Document Loader:** Retrieves whitelisted files, stamps `fetchedAt`, suppresses stale responses, and broadcasts status updates through an ARIA live region.
- **State Reset:** `clearSavedData()` wipes all viewer cache keys, resets UI state, then triggers the refresh routine to rebuild from disk/network.

### Testing Summary
- ✅ `python -m http.server 8000` (manual verification of viewer rendering, keyboard navigation, probe execution, caching rehydration, and reset workflows).
- ⚠️ `npx awesome-lint` / `npx markdownlint-cli2` / `npx lychee` remain blocked by the mandatory proxy at `http://proxy:8080` (HTTP 403), so npm-based linting could not be demonstrated.

### Key Decisions & Rationale
- **Single-file HTML over build tooling:** avoids dependency on the blocked npm pipeline, ensuring the demo remains runnable in restricted environments.
- **Vanilla JS + `localStorage`:** provides deterministic caching and faster demo reloads without introducing frameworks that would need bundling.
- **Manual Markdown sanitization:** balances offline needs with security; future work will investigate vendoring a trusted parser once available offline.
- **Accessibility-first navigation:** meeting MVP inclusivity goals ensures wider usability and aligns with future OSS expectations.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Custom Markdown edge cases:** Mitigated by restricting rendered elements and double-escaping attributes; plan to vendor a parser for full coverage.
- **Offline cache staleness:** Refresh and clear controls plus timestamp display mitigate confusion until precomputed metadata is introduced.
- **Proxy-limited tooling:** Documented constraint; next steps involve cached npm tarballs or proxy credentials to restore tooling parity.

### Follow-Up Considerations
- Replace the custom Markdown renderer with a vetted offline-capable library.
- Bundle precomputed README metadata for faster cold starts and deterministic offline demos.
- Extend accessibility coverage (focus trapping, high-contrast themes) and consider vendoring telemetry logs for presentations.
- Revisit npm tooling once proxy credentials or offline packages are available.
- Add automated smoke tests (Playwright or Cypress) that run against the static viewer when networking constraints are resolved.
